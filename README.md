# born2bebot
Our bot project for the Codam Hackathon: The Clash Of Coalitions. We created a bot that can play the Cluster game and battle against other bots.

Current stats:
We beat the RandomAbelBot with 86%(our bot as player 2) and 96%(our bot as player 1)

# winscript.sh
It is possible to check how often one bot beats another in n games. For that you can edit and execute winscript.sh.

BOT1 and BOT2 define the bot executables, N_GAMES defines the n amount of games.

Execute the winscript like this:

```
  ./winscript.sh
```
