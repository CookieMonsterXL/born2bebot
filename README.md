# born2bebot
Our bot project for the Codam Hackathon: The Clash Of Coalitions. We created a bot that can play the Cluster game and battle against other bots.


# winscript.sh
It is possible to check how often one bot beats another in n games. For that you can edit winscript.sh.

BOT1      defines the bot 1 executable
BOT2      defines the bot 2 executable
N_GAMES   defines the n amount of games
GAME_PATH defines the path to the game

Afterwards, you can execute the winscript like this:

```
  ./winscript.sh
```
