Our bot project



# winscript.sh
If you want to check how often one bot beats another in n games, you can execute the winscript like this:
./winscript

At the top of this script it is possible to define the bots that will play as BOT1 and BOT2, and the n amount of games (N_GAMES) you want them to play.
